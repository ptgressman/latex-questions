\begin{question}[2018.S.7]  %Question name (in this case 2018.S.17) is optional but important for question banking
The region in the plane bounded on the right by the curve $x = \cos y$, on the left by $x=0$, and on the bottom by $y = 0$ is revolved around the $x$-axis. Compute the volume of the resulting solid. \offline{Show all work in the space provided.} \online{Type your answer in the usual format, e.g., no spaces.}

% There are four types of things you can place at the end of a question, after multiple choice options
% \begin{comments}...\end{comments} is for general comments that you'd like all students to see.
% \begin{feedback}...\end{feedback} is for comments you'd make to someone who got a wrong answer.
% \begin{praise}...\end{praise} is for comments you'd make to a student with the correct answer.
% \begin{notes}...\end{notes} are information for yourself or other instructors (e.g., is it tricky in some way)
% \begin{keywords}...\end{keywords} is what it sounds like
\end{question}


% If you add the option "byqref" to the question package and uncomment the lines below, you'll get basic
% question bank functionality. You can tell it's working because we've referred to them in reverse.
% You'll also get a blank first page if you also have the "exam" option, i.e., \usepackage[exam,byqref]{questions} ,
% and you left the \scratchbreak above
